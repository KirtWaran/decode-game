# De-Code
A game of cracking the code sequence through analytical reasoning

# Instructions

A four digit code is made by the machine using the numbers 1 to 8 without repeating any number.

You get 20 chances to guess the number. If you get the correct digit and position of the number, the machine indicates it with a '+' symbol. If you guess correct digit but the wrong position, the machine indicates it with a '-' symbol. If the digit you have guessed does not exist in the code, the machine indicates it with a 'o'.

By looking at your choices and the machine's response, you will have to figure out what the code is and get a '++++' from the machine. If you are able to do that within 20 tries, you win.
